  <h2>Dataset</h2>

  <p>
    Why is the US such a wealthy country?<br/><br/>
    We are interested in how the US became such a wealthy country.  We think this is due to oil being priced in dollars but we are not sure
    and would like to explore this topic more.

    The data is available online at:
    The data was pulled from many sources but the primary source was the Fed.

  <h2>Discoveries &amp; Insights</h2>

  <div class="entry">
    <img src="inflation.jpg" />
    <p class="caption">
      I chose to use area graphs as they are a good way of showing changes in the number of items. An area graph shows at a glance the general
      shape and rate of growth/contraction of each measurement. This graph appears to show a general inverse relationship between inflation and 
      money supply but this is misleading.   I was really surprised that there did not seem to be a direct connection between money supply and 
      inflation. It seems most of the effects of money creation seems to be in hard assets such as home prices. Inflation is far more complicated 
      than just money supply in circulation. I think taking a look at how the US dollar is used in international trade may shed light on what this 
      graph is showing.

    <img src="currency_trading.jpg" />
    <p class="caption">
      As can be seen by the size of the square for the U.S., the dollar is used in most worldwide transactions. 
      This is due to many commodities priced in the dollar as well as the dollar being a tier 1 asset, considered
      the most stable in the world. Since the dollar is traded so heavily this has allowed the US to borrow well 
      beyond its means and still not face a lot of inflation. Other counties, do not have this advantage
      and thus face a lot more inflation.

    <img src="Angola_vs_Oil.jpg" />
    <p class="caption">
      The trends of Crude Oil Prices and the Angolan GDP by Year.  Angola is a very resource rich country in Africa which makes it vulnerable to the
      "resource curse" which happens when an economy becomes too dependent on resources to drive economic growth.  In developed and developing economies
      (such as America), several sectors lead to economic growth making them more resilient to resource price changes.

  <div class="entry">
    <img src="Construction_vs_Hospitality.jpg" />
    <p class="caption">
      The trends of construction and hospitality jobs by Year.  Developed countries in the world have seen a shift from labor jobs to a service economy.
      This can be seen with the rapid growth of hospitality jobs compared to construction.  This trend shows how the US economy has progress on the 
      whole even with the major recessions and turmoil of the past 80 years.

  <div class="entry">
    <img src="Manufacturing_vs_Health.jpg" />
    <p class="caption">
      The trends of manufacturing and health jobs for the past 80 years.  Developed economies throughout the world have seen a shift from labor jobs to
      serviced based jobs such as health.  As seen around the year 2003, healthcare jobs began to grow faster than manufacturing signifying this economic
      shift.  The consistent shift from manufacturing to health jobs shows how the US economy is both constantly changing and quickly adapts to these changes.

  <div class="entry">
    <img src="Saudi_Arabia_vs_Oil.jpg" />
    <p class="caption">
      The trends of Crude Oil Price vs Saudi Arabian GDP by year.  Unlike the Angolan GDP graph, Saudi Arabia's GDP does not follow the price of oil as closely.
      This recent gap between oil prices and GDP is a signal of Saudi Arabia trying to diversify its economy similar to other developed countries such as the US.
      The US economy is extremely diversified and therefore, similar to the recent trends in Saudi GDP, does not rely on any specific commodity price.

      Question:  How does the debt in the United States compare to China? The graph displayed shows the percentage of debt both China and the United States 
      have in relation to their GDP between the years of 2001 and 2020. Two important aspects to point out in particular is sharp increase of debt during 
      the housing crisis of 2008 for the United States, and an even sharper increase of debt for both countries from 2019 to 2020. The sharp increase in 
      2020 is without a doubt due to the global pandemic, and was a constant factor in every country.

    <p class="caption">
      Question: Is Germany's debt repayment related to the increase in China's debt  The graph displayed shows the percentage of debt both China and the
      Germany have in relation to their GDP between the years of 2001 and 2020. I chose these two countries in particular because Germany one country that 
      has actively been tackling their debt to other countries and have the statistics to support it. Even with the sharp increase in 2020, from 2010 to 2019, 
      Germany was able to reduce their debt by over 20%.

      Question: Which stock exchange performed better: The New York Stock Exchange or the Shanghai Stock Exchange? This visual displays the trends of all the
      yearly highs for the Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE) and the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) from 1998 to 2021. I wanted to see which of the two had an
      overall better performance. I was expecting the NYSE to have a higher consistent value than the SSE since the NYSE has been around since 1966, whereas 
      the SSE has been around since 1990. However, this was disproven in 2007, when the SSE was clearly performing significantly better than the NYSE.

      Question: Which country has the highest unemployment rate: The United States or China? This visual displays the unemployment trends in the United States 
      and China from 1950 to 2016. I wanted to see which country had the highest unemployment rate. At first, I was a bit shocked to see that the US has a 
      higher unemployment rate compared to China, however, the US has also had a significantly bigger population compared to china. For example, in the 1950s, 
      China's population was 552 million people, whereas the US population in 1950 was 151 million.
