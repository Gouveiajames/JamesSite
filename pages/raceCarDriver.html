            <p>My Mom won tickets to see a Trans Am race at Sears Point.  My Dad took me to the races and I remember seeing the rainex car of Scott Sharp
                win the race with the Hot Wheels car of Jack Baldwin coming in second.  That was it, I was hooked at 11 years old!  All I have ever wanted to do after that
                is race cars.  I am between race cars at the moment but I hope to have another car soon!
