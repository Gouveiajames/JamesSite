            <p>There is a beauty in a design that just works.  An amazing feat of engineering is just as awe inspiring as any piece of art.  I find myself drawn to computers
                as I love the problems that they can solve.  This interest in engineering led me to persue a degree in Computer Science.  I am currently in my last semester 
                and am very excited for the future!  My main interests are in Cyber Security and Embedded Systems.
